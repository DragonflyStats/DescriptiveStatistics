Find the three quartiles and the IQR of the following data

 15  34  7  12  18  9  1  42  56  28  13  24  35

•	First sort the data set into ascending order

1 7  9 12 13 15 18  24 28 34 35 42 56

•	Count how many items are in the data set ( answer 13 items)

•	Which value is the second quartile, which is the median (answer: the 7th item, which is 18)

•	Q1  median of data less than or equal to median ( 7 items)

1	7  9 12 13 15 18 
 Answer: the 4th item, which is 12
•	Q3  median of data greater than or equal to median ( also 7 items)

18  24 28 34 35 42 56 
Answer: the 4th item of this 7, which is 34

The three quartiles are therefore Q1 = 12, Q2 = 18, Q3 = 34
The interquartile range is therefore Q3 – Q1 = 22
